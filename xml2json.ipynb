The marks for each program ranged from 0.0 to 6.0, the latter being the highest. These marks were used to determine a preference ranking, or ordinal, separately for each judge. The judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program. The individual with the lowest sum of the factored placements was declared the winner.\n",

The referee will signal advantage with their arm out horizontally, toward the non-infringing team. If no tactical or territorial advantage is gained, the referee will whistle, and give the decision that had been delayed. If sufficient advantage is gained, the referee will call \"advantage over\", and play will continue. The Advantage Law allows the game to flow more freely, and not stop for every minor infringement. An example of the application of advantage would be if Team A knocked the ball on (technical offence, conceding a scrum) but a Team B player picked the ball up and made a run forwards before being tackled.\n",

      "Description {} Two Alpine Skiing events (Slalom and Giant Slalom) were introduced at the first Paralympic Winter Games in �rnsk�ldsvik, Sweden, in 1976. Athletes in Alpine Skiing events must combine speed and agility while racing down slopes at speeds of around 100km/h. Paralympic competition accommodates male and female athletes with a physical disability such as spinal injury, cerebral palsy, amputation, les autres conditions and blindness/visual impairment. Athletes compete in three categories based on their functional ability, and a results calculation system allows athletes with different disabilities to compete against each other. The rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS) are used with only a few modifications. Skiers with blindness /visual impairment are guided through the course by sighted guides using voice signals to indicate the course to follow. Athletes with physical disabilities use equipment that is adapted to their needs including single skis, sit-skis or orthopaedic aids. \r\n",

The AIS will adopt their definition of athlete self-reported sports trauma. “An immediate sensation of pain, discomfort, or loss of functioning associated, by an athlete, with an isolated exposure to physical energy during sports training or competition having an intensity and quality making the sensation being interpreted by the athlete as discordant with normal body functioning”. This will be recorded in the Athlete Management System in the sessional monitoring form; however customisation of forms is possible.\n",

In addition athletes may use certain assistive devices as specified in the IPC Athletics rules.  This technology continues to advance at a rapid rate. Wheelchairs are considered sports equipment in track and field events. Athletics wheelchairs tend to be very lightweight. The dimensions and features of wheelchairs are clearly specified in the IPC Athletics rules. Prosthetic devices may be used by amputees. These have been specifically developed to withstand the demands of sports competition. IPC rules require the use of leg prostheses in track events. However, the use of prostheses in field events is optional. Rope tethers or other devices may be used by runners with a visual impairment to link with their sighted guides. Acoustic devices, or a sighted caller, may be used to indicate take-off in jumping events, throwing target areas, etc. \n",

He does this because of the way the defensive team has positioned itself and he thinks by changing the play he will be able to catch the defense in a wrong formation and make a big play on them. Or alternatively that the defensive team has positioned itself so that the play that was called in the huddle will not work and needs to be changed.\n",

All eleven players in a cricket side must bat in an unlimited overs match unless a declaration is made. The batting order is usually subdivided into: opening batsmen or openers (the two batsmen who start, or open, the innings), upper or top order (batsmen at positions three and four in the order), middle order (batsmen five to seven), lower order or tail (batsmen eight to eleven). The order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established prior to the commencement of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities, the position each batsman will feel most comfortable in, each player's skills and attributes as a batsman, possible combinations with other batsmen, and the game situation, for example requiring a more defensive or attacking player at that point in the game.  \n",

      "Description {} A beamer (less commonly beam ball) is a type of delivery in which the ball bowled at a fast pace without bouncing, passes above the batsman's waist height.  Such a ball is often dangerously close to the batsman's head, due to the lack of control a bowler has over high full tosses. Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it. This type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty for this type of delivery is an immediate no-ball signal given by the umpire.\n",

It consists of a 7.5km route divided into three 2.5km stages.Between the two stages athletes must hit two targets located at a distance of 10 metres. Each miss is penalised by an increase in the overall route time. The most important success factor lies in the capability of alternating the skills of physical endurance and shooting accuracy during the competition. Athletes with blindness/visual impairment are assisted by acoustic signals, which depending on signal intensity, indicate when the athlete is on target.\r\n",

Adaptive rowing boats are equipped with special seats, which vary according to the disability of the rower. To date, there are no other specifications on the seat apart from the following: the LTA4+ has a sliding seat; the other three boat classes have fixed seats. The TA 2x has a seat, which offers complimentary support. The AW1x and AM1x are equipped with a seat, which offers postural support to those individuals with compromised sitting balance (i.e. spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy). This ensures that the upper body is supported and kept in a fixed position. Smaller boats are equipped with buoyancy devices called pontoons, which act as stabilisers attached to the boats riggers, providing additional lateral balance.\r\n",

Competition sleds must be a maximum of 3.80 m (12.5 ft) long (4-crew) or 2.70 m (8.9 ft) long (2-crew). The runners on both are set at 0.67 m (2.2 ft) gauge. Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed. Now, the maximum weight, including crew, is 630 kg (1,388.9 lbs) (4-man), 390 kg (859.8 lbs) (2-man), or 340 kg (749.6 lbs) (2-woman), which can be reached via the addition of metal weights.\r",

      "Description {} Chin music is a term for a bowling strategy where bouncers are aimed at the batsman's throat or chin.  Rising rapidly off the pitch, the ball is difficult to play unless the batsman has quick footwork. Better left alone, it yields a ballooned return catch to the bowler or to close-in fielders. This is a difficult ball to bowl, since a few inches on either side would present the batsman with a short ball that can be easily put away on either side of the pitch. It is not illegal in cricket, but the number of short deliveries allowed in an over is usually restricted, and bowlers who exceed this may get a warning from the umpire. This tactic was made famous by the England team in the controversial 'Bodyline' Ashes series in 1932.\n",

      "Description {} A dead ball is a particular state of play in which the players may not perform any of the active aspects of the game. In other words, batsmen may not score runs and fielders may not attempt to get batsmen out. The ball, referring to the cricket ball, becomes live when the bowler begins his run up in preparation to bowling at the batsman. In the live state, play occurs with the batsmen able to score runs and get out. The ball then becomes dead when any of the following situations occur. The umpire is satisfied that, with adequate reason, the batsman is not ready for the delivery of the ball. The ball passes the batsman, is gathered by the wicket-keeper, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take runs.  The ball is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or the bowler, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take any more runs.  The umpire feels that both the fielding team and the batsmen consider the ball no longer to be in play. The ball reaches the boundary and four runs or six runs are scored. Either batsman is out. The ball lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or umpire. The ball lodges in a protective helmet worn by a fielder. The batsmen attempt to run leg byes, and, in the umpire's opinion, no attempt was made either to hit the ball with the bat or to evade it. This nullifies the leg byes. The umpire intervenes in the occurrence of injury or unfair play.\n",

Equestrian is a multi-disability sport open to athletes with a physical disability or a visual impairment. Events are mixed and grouped according to their functional profiles. Riders compete in two Dressage events, a Championship Test of set movements and a Freestyle Test to music. There is also a Team test for three to four riders per team. Competitors are judged on their display of horsemanship skills as they ride their horse using a series of commands for walk, trot and canter. Riders may use permitted assistive devices such as dressage crops, a connecting rein bar, rubber bands or other aids. Since 2006, the International Equestrian Federation is the governing body for equestrian.\n",

      "Description {} eTID is an online electronic talent identification tool that is simple to use, free and allows anyone (aged 12-29) to assess their sporting potential.  eTID is the brainchild of the Australian Sports Commission's successful National Talent Identification and Development (NTID) program which seeks to identify and develop Australia's future sporting talent. This interactive website allows users to enter in results for a series of simple 'home based' performance tests and measurements which can be used to help identify athletes for selection in NTID development programs.  Accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime, eTID provides opportunities for aspiring or current athletes and even former elite athletes looking to start a new sport. The General Tests section caters for would-be champions aged 12-25 whilst the Sport Specific and Elite Athlete sections will consider athletic hopefuls up to the age of 29.  If your results are identified as above average you will be encouraged to visit a Talent Assessment Centre (TAC) to have your results verified. After assessment, you may then be able to enter the elite sporting system, where you could be supported with coaching, equipment and travel.\n",

      "Description {} The National Injury and Illness Database includes are wide variety of sports ranging from on-water sports (rowing, sailing, canoe/kayak) to in-water sports (diving, swimming, water polo) to athletics, cycling, field team sports (rugby 7’s and hockey) and gymnastics. We propose the “per available training days” as the most pragmatic definition. Similarly to clinical epidemiological studies, this exposure should be normalised to a set amount of days. Therefore, we propose the exposure be reported in “per 100 athlete training days” as this is easily interpreted by a range of backgrounds from governing bodies’ personnel to coaches. For example, a coach with 10 athletes and an incidence rate of 0.5 shoulder injuries per 100 days can expect to see 5 shoulder injuries per 100 days of training. The “per 1000 hours” method, the accepted gold standard in the literature, requires further calculations for the coach estimation example. Furthermore, sports such as equestrian who are spread across 4 continents and train on multiple horses each day may not be able to provide the data in the same level as a swimming group using the same pool each day.\n",

The relaxed application allows players to roll the ball more directly into their team's side of the scrum thus reducing the chances of the other team successfully striking for the ball and gaining possession of it. \"Feeding!\" is an ironic accusation sometimes called out by spectators of a game in response to a player taking advantage of the modern application of the rule.\n",

A fielder or fieldsman may field the ball with any part of his person. However, if while the ball is in play he wilfully fields it otherwise (e.g. by using his hat), the ball becomes dead and 5 penalty runs are awarded to the batting side unless the ball previously struck a batsman not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are in Law 41 of the Laws of cricket.\n",

      "Title {} First Slip\n",
      "Description {} In the sport of cricket, a slip fielder (collectively, a slip cordon or the slips) is placed behind the batsman on the off side of the field. They are placed with the aim of catching an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach. Many teams employ two or three slips (numbered from the slip fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first slip, second slip, etc.). A floating slip is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the slip cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The slip cordon's distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler. Generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicketkeeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer slips in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called slippers.\n",

Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the real ball winners at the breakdown, especially the number 7. The two flankers do not usually bind to the scrum in a fixed position. Instead, the openside flanker will attach to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the blindside flanker attaches themself to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline.\n",

The number of gates is determined by the vertical drop and the penalty for missing a gate is disqualification. Each athlete completes two runs on the same day on different courses. Times from the two courses are added to determine order of finish. (The ranking in the first run is the basis for the starting order in the second run, with the fastest skiing last).\n",

      "Description {} Awarded when a defending player grounds the ball in his own in-goal area, is tackled with the ball in his own in-goal area, or when a defending player plays the ball \"dead\" (into touch) behind his own goal line. The defending team must kick the ball from their own goal line and beneath the uprights to a minimum distance of ten metres. Note that if a player grounds the ball on his own goal line in a tackle, he is regarded as being in the field of play, and play continues. This is contrary to the definition of a try, where the goal line counts as the in-goal area.\n",

It was invented in 1946 in an effort to rehabilitate the blind veterans from World War II and made its Paralympic debut in 1976 in Toronto. Goalball competitions are set apart from all other Paralympic events due to the unique atmosphere inside the playing venue. The object is to roll the ball into the opponent's goal while the opposing players try to block the ball with their bodies. Bells inside the ball help to orientate the players by indicating the direction of the oncoming ball. Therefore, while play is in progress, complete silence is required in the venue to allow the players to concentrate and react instantly to the ball. Goalball is played by male and female athletes with blindness / visual impairment and athletes wear blackout masks on the playing court. This allows persons with varying degrees of vision to participate together. The game consists of two halves of 10 minutes each.  \n",

It is used to calculate a net score from the number of strokes actually played during a competition, thus allowing players of different proficiency to play against each other on somewhat equal terms. The higher the handicap of a player, the poorer the player is relative to those with lower handicaps. Handicap systems are not used in professional golf.\n",

Or through repetitive friction from the overlying muscles and tendons, usually during running. This repeated friction results in the bursa becoming inflamed and swollen. Every time the tendons then rub over the bursa, this causes pain.\n",

Due to the pressure put on the body by the scrum and the requirement to use both arms to bind to other players (and hence having no free arm to use to support or deflect bodyweight) it is considered to be one of the most dangerous positions to play.  Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs, partly because they are normally the shortest of the forwards, but more often because they are the most skillful of the forwards.  \n",

It follows the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) with modifications. Instead of skates, players use two-blade sledges that allow the puck to pass beneath. Players use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. Ic Sledge Hockey is an 8 Team Tournament.\r\n",

There are fewer players in an indoor hockey team with teams comprising a maximum of 12 players with only five, including the goalkeeper, allowed on the pitch at any one time and up to seven substitutes. The field of play is much smaller, a hard surface in a sports hall or similar venue, with boards along the sidelines that prevent the ball from going out of play at the side.\n",

A tie at the end of regulation play forces extra innings. The game continues until an inning is complete and the visitors have a higher score, or until the home team breaks the tie then they don’t complete the 3 outs.\n",

      "Description {} An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports � most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring.   In many other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item. In baseball and cricket, however, one team said to be batting, attempts to score runs while the other team, said to be fielding, attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out. The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players out, making a clock unnecessary.  In cricket, the term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player.  The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat. \n",

The opposition are not allowed to encroach beyond the 10-metre line until the ball is kicked.  If the ball does not travel 10 metres goes straight into touch or goes over the dead ball line at the end of the pitch the opposing team may accept the kick, have the ball kicked off again, or have a scrum at the centre.  After a score the game is restarted from the same place under the same restrictions with the conceding team drop-kicking the ball to the scoring team.

The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket (Korf) that is mounted on a 3.5 m (11.5 feet) high pole.\r",
      "Teams of eight players divide into two sections, two male, two female in each section. The korfball playing area consists of two large squares joined along the centre line, within each square is a ‘korf’ set in one third from the back line.\r",
      "The sport was developed in the Netherlands by school-teacher Nico Broekhuysen who founded the sport in 1902 so that boys and girls could play together on equal terms, encouraging team work and cooperation.\r",
      "One section starts the game in attack, the other in defence, but players swap roles after every two goals scored throughout the game.\r",
      "The sport is based on cooperation within the team, and the rules provide equality – players can only mark or be marked by an opposing player of the same sex.\r",
      "Individual challenges and competitiveness are still enjoyed within this framework that priorities teamwork and equality.\n",

      "Description {} A leg cutter is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is bowled by fast bowlers.  A bowler releases a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the left side of the ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side.\n",

      "Description {} A mark is the place where the game will restart after a stoppage, such as where a scrum-offence or penalty offence occurred, or on the touchline where the ball went out of play (or where the ball was kicked in the case of ball-back). Marks are generally defined by the referee, or the touch judge when the ball leaves play by the touchline.  Marks can also be defined by a defending players who execute a clean catch (catch the ball before it bounces or touches another player) of a ball kicked by an attacking player if the defender is standing within his / her own 22 metre zone or in-goal. To \"call a mark\", the player shouts \"Mark!\" as he/she catches the ball. The referee then awards that player a free kick which must be taken by that specific player. (If for whatever reason, that player cannot take the kick, a scrum is awarded instead.) If the player is simply a poor kicker he / she is likely to take a 'Tap Kick' and immediately pass the ball to the fly-half or full back who will generally deliver a clearance kick.  Marks can be called when the ball is cleanly caught following a kick by the opposition for any type of kick except a kick off or restart after a score. It is legal, though very unusual, to call a mark from a clean catch of a Penalty Kick.  \n",

      "Description {} The Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) connects the inner (medial) surfaces of the femur (thigh bone) and the tibia (shin bone). Its function is to resist forces applied from the outer surface of the knee and so prevent the medial (inner) portion of the joint from widening under stress. Injury to the MCL often occurs after an impact to the outside of the knee when the knee is slightly bent. The MCL on the inside of the knee becomes stretched and if the force is great enough, some or even all of the fibres will tear. The deep part of ligament is prone to becoming damaged first and this may lead to medial meniscal damage also\n",

      "Description {} The nature of the National Injury and Illness Database is to collect all medico legal requirements of the clinician simultaneously with epidemiological data. Therefore, all medical attention injuries will be recorded. The definition of a medical attention injury is “an assessment of an athlete’s medical condition by a qualified medical/healthcare practitioner”. This definition does not include incidents such as strapping of a joint or other routine care services. These incidents shall be recorded as “maintenance treatments”. Care must be taken when analysing this data as it is likely to overestimate the number of injuries as early presentation is encouraged in Australian elite sporting settings. Consequently, this data is likely to be biased towards minor injuries that are inconsequential to lost time or performance. Systematic bias is also likely where non-uniform care is available.\n",

      "Description {} In the sport of cricket a no ball is a penalty against the fielding team, usually as a result of an illegal delivery by the bowler. The delivery of a no ball results in one run to be added to the batting team's score, and an additional ball must be bowled. In addition, the number of ways in which the batsman can be given out is reduced. In twenty20 and recently one-day cricket matches, a batsman receives a 'free hit' on the ball after a 'front foot' no ball.  This means the batsman can freely hit the ball with no danger of being out in certain ways. No balls are not uncommon, especially in short form cricket, and fast bowlers tend to bowl them more often than spin bowlers due to their longer run-up.\n",

However, in limited overs games, such as One Day Internationals, two batsmen will often be noted as not out, as the innings finishes after a certain number of overs has been bowled.\n",

It is the standard used in competitive weightlifting where men and women compete at the highest level - the Commonwealth Games, Pan-American Games, World Championships, and the Olympics. The total weight of the barbell varies based on the type and number of plates loaded onto the ends of the bar and the lift being performed and can be as much as 1,000 pounds (450 kg).  A women's Olympic bar is similar to the men's bar, but is shorter 2.05 m (6.73 ft) and lighter 15 kg ( 33.07 lbs) with a smaller grip section diameter (25 mm). Also in contrast to the men's bar, the women's bar does not sport a centre knurl.\n",

The decision should be made in the normal manner by the Marker, subject to appeal to the Referee.\n",

      "Description {} The Pan Pacific Masters Games is an international sporting event held on the Gold Coast at the beginning of November every two years.  Around 10,000 participants from all over the world compete in the multi-sport competition, which runs for one week at various venues across the city. The minimum age requirement is 30 years of age for most.  The Pan Pacific Masters Games first began on the Gold Coast in 1996 and was originally called the Queensland Masters Games.  In 1998 it became the larger Asia Pacific Masters Games which were held three more times on the Gold Coast - in 1998, 2000 and 2002.  The event was renamed the Pan Pacific Masters Games in 2002 to reflect growing interest from Asia, Japan, the Americas, Oceania and New Zealand.  http://www.mastersgames.com.au  \n",

Later it changed from �Weightlifting� to �Powerlifting�. The competition is open to all athletes with cerebral palsy, spinal injuries, short stature, amputees (lower limb amputees only) and les autres who meet minimal disability criteria. Powerlifting is the ultimate test of upper body strength. Competitors must lower the bar to the chest, hold it motionless on the chest and then press it upwards to arms length with locked elbows. The bench press is the only discipline with 10 different categories based on body weight. The athletes are given three attempts and the winner is the athlete who lifts the highest number of kilograms.\r\n",

The National Injury and Illness Database has adopted the scoring system proposed by Clarsen et. al. where the proposed definition of a recordable incident (injury or illness) is inappropriate. For example, the prevalence of shoulder pain in Australian water polo players is currently monitored via weekly questionnaires based on the Clarsen method. It is expected that this method will be adopted where appropriate among NSOs into the future. The Clarsen method requires input from the athlete and where this is unobtainable it is possible to measure the prevalence of missed or modified training and competition due to injury or illness from participation records. This allows similar data to be collected without the reliance of athlete self-reports.\n",

It involves slapping the ball rapidly, either with one hand or alternating between both hands, creating the necessary rhythm of slaps and bounces needed to keep the ball bouncing. Gradually increasing the strength of slaps and broadening the rhythm results in \"lifting\" the ball up, where a normal dribble may be resumed.\n",

ROS form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signaling. However, during times of environmental stress (such as for example, UV or heat exposure) ROS levels can increase dramatically, which can result in significant damage to cell structures. This cumulates into a situation known as oxidative stress. They are also generated by exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation.\r\n",

That is, if a team thinks that an official made a wrong call on a play they can ask the referee to review the play and they do this by throwing a red flag unto the field where a referee can see it. The instant replay takes place by the referee looking into a monitor on the field. He first consults with the official who made the call on the play. The referee looks at a monitor and if he feels that there is incontrovertible visual evidence or it is beyond doubt that a mistake was made, then the referee can change the call that was made. But if there is not incontrovertible evidence then the play stands as called. The reviews are not suppose to take longer than 90 seconds, from the time the referee starts to look at the replay. If the play is not changed then the team that made the challenge loses a time out.\n",

You can tackle the quarterback hard but not after they have gotten rid of the ball.\n",

The offside line becomes the last foot of the last man on each side of the ruck and players compete for the ball by attempting to drive one another from the area and to 'ruck' the ball backwards with their feet.  Rucks commonly form at tackles, but can form anywhere in the field of play where the ball is on the ground. Handling the ball while it is in the vicinity of a ruck is a penalty offence. (Though modern practice allows a player on the ground to support the ball with his / her hands and for the player who is acting as scrum half to 'dig' for the ball once possession has been secured.) If the ball does not come out of a ruck after about five seconds, the referee will award a scrum to the team he considers to have been moving forward in the ruck.\n",

The scrum-half from the team that has been awarded possession feeds the ball into the centre of the scrum from the side most advantageous for his hooker (which is typically the side of loose head prop).  The ball must be fed straight down the middle of the tunnel and the hookers must not contest for the ball until it is put in. If they do, a free-kick is awarded for \"foot up\".  The scrum is taken again if the ball comes straight out of the tunnel or if it collapses. If the scrum wheels (rotates) due to pushing more than 90 degrees the scrum is reformed and awarded to the other side. Pulling in an attempt to unbalance the other side or to assist in rotating the scrum is a Penalty Offence.\n",

      "Description {} Also known as a half-back, they are the players traditionally wearing shirt number 9. Scrum halves form the all-important link between the forwards and the backs. They are relatively small but with a high degree of vision, the ability to react to situations very quickly, and good handling skills.  They are often the first tackler in defence and are behind every scrum, maul or ruck to get the ball out and maintain movement. They put the ball into the scrum and collect it afterwards. Scrum Halves generally also act as \"receiver\" in the line-out to catch the ball knocked down by the forwards. (The receiver is a member of the line out and so stands within 10 metres of it and may join the line once the ball is thrown.)\n",

Each stick has a maximum length of 1m and is made of wood, plastic or aluminium / titanium. The blade has a maximum length of 25cm, except for the goaltender's blade, which has a maximum length of 35cm. The pick end of the stick must not damage the ice surface or inadvertently puncture or slash other players, so the following rules apply: No part of the pick or teeth may come to a sharp point, the pick must not extend more than 1cm anywhere beyond the stick, the pick must have at least six teeth, each with a maximum length of 4mm.  The goaltender may have an additional pick at the base end of his stick. The goaltender may also use an additional stick with a blade or a trapper glove with teeth.\r\n",

      "Description {} Since the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960, swimming has been one of the main sports of the Paralympics. Like the Olympic Games, competitors measure their skills in freestyle, backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke and medley events. Swimming is open to both male and female competitors who have a physical disability, intellectual disability or blindness / visual impairment. Athletes are classified based on their functional ability to perform each stroke. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) rules are followed with a few modifications, such as optional platform or in-water starts for some races, and the use of signals or tappers for swimmers with blindness / visual impairment. No prostheses or assistive devices are permitted. \r\n",

Players may not run with the disc, and must keep a pivot while holding the disc. The word \"ultimate\" in the title refers to the fact that, since originally there were to be no referees, the game required the ultimate in honour to play.\r\n",

      "\r",
      "There are two teams of 12 players which will bat and field two innings each (except in the event that a team wins with an innings in hand). The aim of the game is for a team to score more runs than the opposition team.\r",

      "There are no overs and the batters bat from one end only. Two bowlers bowl alternately and can incorporate any type of \"throwing\" action as long as the ball is released above the shoulder (i.e. not underarm).\r",

      "If the ball is hit forward of the crease, the batters must run.\r",
      "\r",
      "A run is completed each time both batters safely make it to the crease at the opposite end of the pitch. Fours and sixes also apply where the batter hits the ball past the boundary markers. In addition to shots made off the bat, byes and leg-byes add to the team's score.\r",
      "\r",
      "Players may be dismissed by the same methods as in cricket – bowled, caught, run out, stumped, leg before wicket, hit wicket, handled ball and hit the ball twice.\n",

Today, it continues to be one of the most popular sports at the Paralympic Games. To be eligible to play wheelchair basketball, a person must in their lower limbs have an objective and measurable permanent physical disability, which prevents them from running, jumping and pivoting as an able-bodied player. By classification, players are assigned a point value from 1.0 to 4.5 according to their level of physical function. These points are then added together in a game where a team is not permitted to exceed 14.0 points for the five players on court. This ensures that any player regardless of degree of disability, has an integral role to play in the team structure. Observed trunk movements and stability during actual basketball participation, not medical diagnosis form the basis of player classification. \r\n",

The only difference in wheelchair tennis competitions is that the ball is allowed to bounce twice - the first bounce being within the bounds of the court. Athletes must have a permanent substantial or total loss of function in one or both legs. For the quad division the eligibility criteria requires a player to have a disability in three or more limbs. The events are singles (between two players) and doubles (between two pairs). The winner of a match is the first athlete or pair to win two sets. \r\n",
