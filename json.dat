This is a difficult ball to bowl, since a few inches on either side would present the batsman with a short ball that can be easily put away on either side of the pitch. It is not illegal in cricket, but the number of short deliveries allowed in an over is usually restricted, and bowlers who exceed this may get a warning from the umpire.

The ball, referring to the cricket ball, becomes live when the bowler begins his run up in preparation to bowling at the batsman. In the live state, play occurs with the batsmen able to score runs and get out. The ball then becomes dead when any of the following situations occur. The umpire is satisfied that, with adequate reason, the batsman is not ready for the delivery of the ball. The ball passes the batsman, is gathered by the wicket-keeper, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take runs.  The ball is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or the bowler, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take any more runs.  The umpire feels that both the fielding team and the batsmen consider the ball no longer to be in play. The ball reaches the boundary and four runs or six runs are scored. Either batsman is out. The ball lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or umpire. The ball lodges in a protective helmet worn by a fielder. The batsmen attempt to run leg byes, and, in the umpire's opinion, no attempt was made either to hit the ball with the bat or to evade it. This nullifies the leg byes.

Therefore, we propose the exposure be reported in \u201cper 100 athlete training days\u201d as this is easily interpreted by a range of backgrounds from governing bodies\u2019 personnel to coaches. For example, a coach with 10 athletes and an incidence rate of 0.5 shoulder injuries per 100 days can expect to see 5 shoulder injuries per 100 days of training. The \u201cper 1000 hours\u201d method, the accepted gold standard in the literature, requires further calculations for the coach estimation example. Furthermore, sports such as equestrian who are spread across 4 continents and train on multiple horses each day may not be able to provide the data in the same level as a swimming group using the same pool each day.","Related Terms":["Data dictionary for the National Injury and Illness Database"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Express","Description":"Direct, written or spoken.","Related Terms":["Legal"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Expunge","Description":"To totally destroy or erase something.","Related Terms":["Legal"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extending","Description":"When the arm holding the weapon is straightened toward the target.","Related Terms":["Fencing terms and techniques"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extension (Figure Skating)","Description":"The way a body part is held in a stretched position.","Related Terms":["Figure Skating terms and techniques"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extension (Strength & Conditioning)","Description":"Straightening of a joint: a movement that returns a body segment to the anatomical position from a flexed position.","Related Terms":["Strength & Conditioning","Flexion"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term","Related"]},{"Title":"Extensor","Description":"Muscle that extends a limb or increases the joint angle.","Related Terms":["Strength & Conditioning"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extensor Digitorum Muscles","Description":"Extends phalanges of each finger.","Related Terms":["Muscles"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extensor Hallicus","Description":"Extends toes and dorsiflexes foot.","Related Terms":["Muscles"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"External Oblique","Description":"Flex spine and \/ or compress abdomen, involved in activities such as abdominal curl exercises.","Related Terms":["Abdominal Muscles"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extinguish","Description":"To wipe out, make non-existent.","Related Terms":["Legal"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Extra","Description":"An extra (sometimes called a sundry) is a run scored by a means other than a batsman hitting the ball.

They are placed with the aim of catching an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach. Many teams employ two or three slips (numbered from the slip fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first slip, second slip, etc.). A floating slip is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the slip cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The slip cordon's distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler. Generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicketkeeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer slips in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called slippers.","Related Terms":["Fielding positions"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"First Stroke","Description":"Instantaneous velocity of vertex of head when hands part to commence stroke cycle.","Related Terms":["Turns (Swimming)"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"FIS","Description":"Federation Internationale de Ski - includes Alpine, Nordic Combined, Cross Country, Freestyle, Ski Jumping and Snowboarding.","Related Terms":["Alpine Skiing organisations","Freestyle Skiing organisations","Federation Internationale de Ski","International Ski Federation","Internationler Ski Verband"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term","Narrower Term","Used For","Used For","Used For"]},{"Title":"FIS Cross Country World Cup","Description":"http:\/\/www.fis-ski.com\/","Related Terms":["Cross Country Skiing competitions","International competitions","Skiing competitions"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term","Narrower Term","Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"FIS Hotham Australia New Zealand Cup (skiing)","Description":"http:\/\/www.mthotham.com.au","Related Terms":["Alpine Skiing competitions","International competitions","Alpine Skiing"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term","Narrower Term","Related"]},{"Title":"FISA","Description":"Federation Internationale des Societes d'Aviron (International Rowing Federation)\rwww.worldrowing.com\r","Related Terms":["International Sporting Organisation","Rowing organisations","Federation Internationale des Societes d'Aviron","International Rowing Federation"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term","Narrower Term","Used For","Used For"]},{"Title":"FISA World Cup","Description":"http:\/\/www.worldrowing.com\/","Related Terms":["Rowing competitions"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"FISA World Rowing Championships","Description":"http:\/\/www.worldrowing.com\/","Related Terms":["Rowing competitions"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Fiscal Year","Description":"Fiscal year is the twelve-month period over which an entity reports on the activities that appear in its annual financial statements.","Related Terms":["Finance"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Fistmele","Description":"The proper distance between the handle of a bow and the bow string when the bow is strung.","Related Terms":["Bow (Archery)"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"FITA","Description":"Federation Internationale De Tir A L'arc (International Archery Federation)\rwww.fita.org\r","Related Terms":["Archery organisations","International Sporting Organisation","Federation Internationale de Tir a L'Arc","International Archery Federation"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term","Narrower Term","Used For","Used For"]},{"Title":"Fitness trainer ","Description":"A qualified instructor that provides advice and guidance on exercise and training routines to promote increased strength, flexibility and performance.","Related Terms":["Sport personnel"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"FItout","Description":"The process of refurbishing a workplace internally.

In many other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item. In baseball and cricket, however, one team said to be batting, attempts to score runs while the other team, said to be fielding, attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out.

It is bowled by fast bowlers.  A bowler releases a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the left side of the ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side.","Related Terms":["Cricket terms and techniques"],"Relationship":["Narrower Term"]},{"Title":"Leg Drive","Description":"Power applied to the stroke, at the catch, by the force of driving the legs down.

A leg spinner bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action, causing the ball to spin anti-clockwise at the point of delivery.
